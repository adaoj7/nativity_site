          The Community Area Festival of Nativities began in 2016 as an attempt to gather those with a love of Christ across denominations during the Christmas holiday. Originally spearheaded by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the Sisters of St. Francis of the Immaculate Conception the festival has grown to host more than 1000 nativities and hundreds of volunteers.

          As it has grown, those who are involved have grown closer to the Savior and to the joy of giving that comes during the Christmas season.
