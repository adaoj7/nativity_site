                            The Jobs Partnership is a faith-based program that
                            brings together local churches and area businesses
                            to train, equip, and employ citizens in the Peoria
                            and surrounding counties. The primary goal is to
                            bring program participants from dependency to
                            self-sufficiency, to help them get and keep a job.
                            Participants are required to complete a free 8-12
                            week classroom course designed to promote personal
                            growth and professional success, including Biblical
                            perspectives on practical work principles and
                            habits. Volunteers focus on making participants
                            productive, tax-paying citizens and supporting
                            families who contribute to the wellness of the local
                            community. It was founded on the idea that
                            relationships are key to changing and improving
                            lives. It was brought to Peoria in 2000 through the
                            efforts of Heaven's View Christian Fellowship, and
                            has expanded to Bloomington-Normal, a few county
                            jails, several state prisons, the Federal Prison
                            system and to international communities. Locally,
                            some classes are held at the Federal prison, county

                        <p className="p-6">
                            Neal Glassett has logged 86 in-flight hours and
                            11,000 miles transporting medical patients around
                            the country in his first year with LifeLine Pilots.
                            Founded in 1981, by Wanda Whitsitt of Champaign, IL,
                            LifeLine Pilots' mission is to coordinate free air
                            transportation, through volunteer pilots, for
                            passengers with medical and humanitarian needs far
                            from home. These private flights provide medical
                            patients with a safe travel environment reducing
                            risk of exposure in their vulnerable conditions.
                            They also get patients to their destinations more
                            quickly than commercial flights can. LifeLine Pilots
                            began as a small group of pilots in Illinois who
                            envisioned using their special skill of flying to
                            help people with emergencies to reach medical
                            centers. Neal learned about this program while he
                            was receiving his pilot licensure training in 2016.
                            He knew he wanted to use his talents and love for
                            flying to serve others. One of the requirements for
                            LifeLine Pilots is a minimum of 250 hours of flying
                            time. Most Saturdays with fair weather found Neal
                            flying rescue dogs to new owners for Pilots and Paws
                            to acquire the needed hours. In addition to his
                            time, Neal donates 100% of the cost of transporting
                            people and pets in his Piper airplane.

                        <p className="p-6">
                            In 2000, Dr. Gregg Stoner was involved in a
                            faith-based program at his parish, St. Thomas the
                            Apostle, which had a theme of social justice. The
                            program, called JustFaith, was a nine-month program
                            based on scripture that immersed the participants in
                            justice and peace ideas and efforts. At the
                            conclusion of the program, the participants were
                            asked to discern in what way he or she was willing
                            to make a concrete effort on behalf of justice and
                            peace.
                        </p>
                        <p className="p-6">
                            As the program concluded, Dr. Stoner made the
                            decision to leave his very successful private
                            practice in medicine and join an emerging Health
                            Care Clinic for the uninsured in Peoria. This clinic
                            had been founded by a former bishop of the Catholic
                            diocese of Peoria, and was beginning to have an
                            impact on the Peoria area. Its mission is to provide
                            high quality, affordable, comprehensive primary
                            health care for those who were unable to afford it.
                            Dr. Stoner is now the chief medical officer for
                            Heartland Health Clinic. The clinic has grown from
                            one location to the present eight locations in the
                            tri-county area to better serve the community.
                        </p>
                        <p className="p-6">
                            For his selfless, community-minded service, Dr.
                            Gregg Stoner was the 2018 Light the World recipient.

                            These Sisters have blessed thousands of lives since
                            their 1891 inception by Mother Mary Pacifica,
                            baptized Margaret Forrestal, when she responded to a
                            call to staff an orphanage in Metamora, Illinois.
                            From there, the scope and breadth of the sisterhood
                            has continually increased to include teaching in
                            parish schools and staffing homes for the aging.
                            Currently, the 23 Sisters serve in volunteer
                            capacities ranging from counseling and spiritual
                            guidance in venues throughout the community
