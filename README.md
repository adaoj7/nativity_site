This project is an attempt to rebuild a website for a community nativity festival.

The final project will enable them to manage volunteers, store nativities, and other access other important features making the volunteer work more focused on the end goal of a well run program.

Features that have been implemented so far:
- The ability to limit volunteers who sign up for a specific shift
- Pass all those who volunteer for a shift back to the database
- Allow those in charge to be able to query the database in order to know who has signed up for shifts already
